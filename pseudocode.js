    Case 1: If x = rock, the outcome is as follows:
        y = rock, outcome = draw
        y = paper, outcome = lose
        y = scissor, outcome = win
    Case 2: If x = paper, the outcome is as follows:
        y = rock, outcome = win
        y = paper, outcome = draw
        y = scissor, outcome = lose
    Case 3: If x = scissor, the outcome is as follows:
        y = rock, outcome = lose
        y = paper, outcome = win
        y = scissor, outcome = draw
